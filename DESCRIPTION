Description: This package allows the user to access lazily-loaded, compressed and formatted spatial data from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The spatial data is contained in the package as an `sf` object and can called using its name (eg sa12016). It can then be combined with information to be mapped using `ggplot2`'s `geom_sf`.
